Of note - all the professions shown are those that would work in this particular mansion.
Gardener, greenhouse.
Chef, kitchen.
Farmhand, orchard.
Chimney sweep, den.
Maid, arguably like the whole house.
Jockey, a relatively archaic form of driver - garage.
Angel, Chapel / Cloister

The maid's given 'location' is an interesting thought though.
If there is a particular room that best represents a cleaning person's responsibility, like Utility or the Storeroom.
