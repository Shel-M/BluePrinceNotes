Alzara - Fortune Teller
---
And, as it was foretold. I am awakened at the sound of a dropping coin. You find yourself face to face with the great Alzara. And I suspect you wish me to look into your future...

I see a boy. A boy standing on a shore of white sand. He is looking for something
Something he was told he would not find.
I see a black cat tied to a red flag. 
I hear the wind blowing, but the flag does not stir. 
I see a door marked by a rogue moon. A door that is always locked, but has no key. 
It is the door you are searching for, but can not find.
It is beyond the dark waters???

And as it was foretold.... 
I see a darkened cloud of ruin, familiar to us both. Now decrepit, rundown, and in disrepair.
I see eight red envelopes on eight pedestals
In these I see eight letters penned by eight hands, eight letters of which you will only ever find  7
Just like the art of these rooms, there is a letter missing

I see a shadow in the doorway (dark room) Silent footsteps in the hallways... An unlatched gate, you did not open. 
A missing item you did not take (Entry hall, the lantern on the table is missing)
I see a young boy watched from afar.
A young boy who once was brave, but now, afraid...
What you have heard here has been foreseen
