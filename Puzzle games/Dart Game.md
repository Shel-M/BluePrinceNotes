In the [[Billiards Room]]
This game involves math, but it's not too hard.
Each operation is processed in the order written.
The innermost ring represents addition. In the screenshot, this is essentially "0 + 11"
The second, smaller ring, represents subtraction, adding to the equation "0 + 11 - 3"
The third ring is multiplication, hence "(0 + 11 - 3) * 3"
The last ring is division - "((0 + 11 - 3) * 3) / 4"
This provides a final result of 6.
